# Food Delivery Data Analysis and Prediction Model Documentation

## 1. Introduction

This document provides an overview of the data analysis and prediction model developed for a food delivery service. The analysis aims to predict successful orders based on various factors such as food type, city, chain, and temporal features.

## 2. Dataset Overview

The original dataset contained the following columns:
- date
- vendor_id
- chain_id
- city_id
- spec (food type)
- successful_orders
- fail_orders

We derived additional columns:
- total_orders (successful_orders + fail_orders)
- success_rate (successful_orders / total_orders)

## 3. Data Preprocessing

3.1 Date Conversion
- fill the missing (null) values
- Remouve duplicates
- Convert data type 
- search for outliers 
- Extracted 'month' and 'day_of_week' as new features
- explore and visualise some metrics 





3.2 Categorical Encoding
- Used LabelEncoder to convert 'spec', 'city_id', and 'chain_id' to numerical values

3.3 Feature Selection
Final features used:
- spec_encoded
- city_encoded
- chain_encoded
- month
- day_of_week
- total_orders

## 4. Model Development

4.1 Model Choice
- Random Forest Regressor was chosen for its ability to handle both numerical and categorical data, and its robustness to overfitting

4.2 Hyperparameter Tuning
- Used GridSearchCV to find optimal hyperparameters
- Parameters tuned: n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_split, min_samples_leaf

4.3 Model Training
- Data split into 80% training and 20% testing sets
- Model trained on the training data with optimal hyperparameters

## 5. Model Evaluation

5.1 Performance Metrics
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R-squared Score

5.2 Feature Importance
- Analyzed and visualized the importance of each feature in predicting successful orders

5.3 Prediction Error Analysis
- Calculated average prediction error by food type, city, and chain

## 6. Visualizations

6.1 Feature Importance Bar Plot
- Visualizes the relative importance of each feature

6.2 Actual vs Predicted Scatter Plot
- Shows the relationship between actual and predicted successful orders

6.3 Heatmap of Predicted Successful Orders
- Visualizes average predicted successful orders by food type and city

6.4 Pair Plot
- Shows relationships between key variables

6.5 Box Plot of Prediction Errors
- Displays distribution of prediction errors by food type

6.6 Violin Plot of Successful Orders
- Shows distribution of successful orders by day of week

6.7 Scatter Plot with Regression Line
- Illustrates relationship between total orders and successful orders

## 7. Key Findings

(Note: Specific findings would depend on the actual results of the analysis. Here are some general points that could be addressed:)

- Most important features in predicting successful orders
- Food types with highest prediction accuracy
- Cities or chains with notable performance
- Temporal patterns in order success (e.g., day of week effects)

## 8. Limitations and Potential Improvements

8.1 Limitations
- Derived variables (total_orders, success_rate) may introduce bias
- Limited temporal data (assuming the dataset covers a short period)
- Potential for overfitting due to encoding of categorical variables

8.2 Potential Improvements
- Incorporate more historical data if available
- Include additional relevant features (e.g., weather, local events)
- Experiment with other machine learning algorithms (e.g., Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks)
- Implement time series analysis for better temporal predictions

## 9. Business Applications

- Inventory management: Predict demand for different food types by city
- Resource allocation: Optimize staffing based on predicted successful orders
- Marketing strategies: Focus on promoting food types with high success rates in specific cities
- Performance improvement: Identify and address factors contributing to low success rates

## 10. Conclusion

This analysis provides a framework for predicting successful orders in the food delivery service. The Random Forest model, along with the various visualizations, offers insights into the factors influencing order success. While the model shows promising results, there's room for improvement through additional data and advanced modeling techniques.

## 11. Future Work

- Implement a time series model for more accurate temporal predictions
- Develop a user interface for easy prediction queries
- Integrate the model with real-time data for dynamic predictions
- Conduct A/B testing to validate model-driven business decisions
